# NgL-Flooder

**NgL-Flooder** is a multiprocess and proxy-enabled tool designed to flood a user's NGL account with a large volume of messages per minute. Utilizing the `requests` module, this tool is compatible with Python versions up to 3.x.

# Replace inactive proxies with active ones

## Why I Made This Tool
One day, I was very upset when my crush posted on Facebook with her NGL link, and some people sent her love messages, making me jealous.

## Update
Hey everyone, I wanted to let you all know that my crush and I have parted ways for good as of 8/17/2024. I will truly miss her. If parallel universes exist, I hope my other self finds her and loves her deeply in that world. For now, I'll hold onto the memories we shared. I pray that she achieves her goals and finds happiness, free from pain and sadness.
